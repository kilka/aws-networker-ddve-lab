# AWS NetWorker Lab - Minimal Configuration File
# 
# INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Copy this file: cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
# 2. Set ONLY the admin_ip_cidr variable below
# 3. All other values have sensible defaults

# ===== REQUIRED CONFIGURATION =====
# Replace with your public IP address for secure access
# To find your IP: curl -s https://api.ipify.org
admin_ip_cidr = "YOUR_IP_ADDRESS/32"  # REQUIRED: e.g., "203.0.113.1/32"

# ===== OPTIONAL CONFIGURATION =====
# The following have good defaults but can be customized if needed

# AWS Region (default: us-east-1)
# aws_region = "us-east-1"

# Project name (affects resource naming)
# project_name = "aws-networker-lab"

# Environment tag
# environment = "dev"

# Instance types (for cost optimization, you can use smaller instances)
# instance_types = {
#   networker_server = "t3.large"   # Minimum recommended: t3.medium
#   ddve            = "m5.xlarge"   # Minimum recommended: t3.large
#   linux_client    = "t3.medium"   # Minimum recommended: t3.small
#   windows_client  = "t3.medium"   # Minimum recommended: t3.small
# }

# Spot Instances Configuration (for 70-90% cost savings)
# use_spot_instances = false  # Set to true to enable spot instances
# spot_price = "0.6"         # Maximum price as percentage of on-demand (0.6 = 60%)

# Marketplace AMIs (required for production use)
# use_marketplace_amis = true
# ddve_ami_mapping = {
#   "us-east-1" = "ami-09e2f4b415eacc1b9"
# }
# networker_ami_mapping = {
#   "us-east-1" = "ami-08560ec5891de83bd"
# }

# Note: Using smaller instances will reduce costs but may impact performance
